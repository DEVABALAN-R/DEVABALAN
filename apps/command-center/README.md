# Command Center (Expo)

The new cross-platform app (iOS, Android, web) that will replace the Vite app at the
repository root. It is being built in phases — see
[`docs/architecture/MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md`](../../docs/architecture/MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md).

**Status: Phase 1, the 2026 UI redesign, the expense manager, and Phase 2 (sign-in, database
auth hardening, two-step sign-in).** The current phase order is in
[`ROADMAP.md`](../../docs/architecture/ROADMAP.md).

- **Expense manager** (Expenses › Transactions, Stats, Budget, Categories, plus Accounts and the
  add/edit sheet) works end to end against an **in-memory preview store** seeded with
  labelled sample data. You can add, edit and delete entries, categories, budgets and accounts.
  Every change is lost on reload, and a "Preview · not saved" badge says so. Flows and rules:
  [`EXPENSE_MANAGER_FLOW.md`](../../docs/architecture/EXPENSE_MANAGER_FLOW.md).
- **People and splits:** split an expense with friends; Stats and budgets count your share, and
  Expenses › People tracks who owes you and records repayments. Notes are suggested as you type,
  and entries can carry a receipt photo (kept in memory in the preview).
- **Notes** (Google Keep style): text notes and checklists with colours, pins, labels, archive
  and search, on the same preview footing.
- **Overview** reads the same expense ledger. Mutual funds and Stocks are designs driven by
  static sample data (fictional names, "Sample data · design preview" badge).
- Goals, Insights and Reports are labelled placeholders.

Signed in (with migrations 0005 and 0006 applied), the expense manager and Notes load and
save **your own** data in Supabase (Phase 3.2); the preview build keeps the labelled sample.
Importing from the existing app is Phase 3.3.

## Sign-in (Phase 2)

Without Supabase settings the app runs as a labelled **preview** and asks for no sign-in. With
them, every `/dashboard` page requires a session (the guard is convenience; Row Level Security
is the real boundary).

### The two values

| Variable (exact name)                  | Value                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`             | The **Project URL**, `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co`, from Supabase → Project Settings → Data API. Nothing after `.supabase.co` (no `/rest/v1`). Not the dashboard address. |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | The **publishable** key (`sb_publishable_…`) from Supabase → Project Settings → API Keys; on older projects, the **anon public** key.                    |

Never use the **secret** (`sb_secret_…`) or **service_role** key: the app refuses both. The old
app's `VITE_SUPABASE_*` names do not work here.

### On Vercel (the live site)

1. Open the Vercel project that builds `apps/command-center` (it serves
   `devabalan-command-center.vercel.app`), not the legacy app's project.
2. **Settings → Environment Variables**: add both variables with the exact names above,
   **Environments: All Environments** (at least Production and Preview). Leave **Sensitive**
   off: Vercel refuses it for public (`EXPO_PUBLIC_`) variables, and these values are public by
   design.
3. **Deployments** → the top **Production** deployment → **⋯ → Redeploy**, with **Use existing
   build cache unticked**. The values are built into the bundle, so a deployment made before
   they were added keeps running in preview.
4. Open the site: it should show **Sign in**. If it still shows the dashboard with
   "Preview · not saved", the build did not receive the variables: re-check the project, the
   names and the environments, then redeploy again.

### Locally

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`, fill in the same two values, and restart with
`npx expo start --clear` (the values are read at build time).

### Supabase redirect URLs

In Supabase → Authentication → URL configuration, add the app's URLs to the redirect allowlist,
for example `https://devabalan-command-center.vercel.app/reset-password` and
`http://localhost:8081/reset-password`.

### What you get

- **Two-step sign-in** (TOTP) is set up in Settings; after the password, `/verify-code` asks for
  the 6-digit code. **Sign out other devices** is in the same card.
- **Sessions:** on web they live in the tab's `sessionStorage`, or in `localStorage` when
  "Keep me signed in on this device" is ticked; on iOS/Android in the encrypted SecureStore.
- **Automatic sign-out** is chosen per device in Settings → This device (Auto, 15 min, 1 hour,
  8 hours, Never).
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, frame blocking) are set in `vercel.json`. Server-side setup
  (sign-up allowlist hook, migrations) is in [`SUPABASE_SETUP.md`](../../SUPABASE_SETUP.md).

## Run

```bash
cd apps/command-center
npm ci
npm run web        # browser
npm run ios        # iOS simulator / Expo Go
npm run android    # Android emulator / Expo Go
```

The design-system gallery is at `/dev/components` (development builds only; production
builds redirect it away).

## Checks (same as CI)

```bash
npm run typecheck
npx eslint . --max-warnings 0
npm run format:check
npm test
npm run build:web && npm run check:bundle
```

## Structure

```

    dashboard/         adaptive shell + destinations
    dev/components     design-system gallery (dev only)

  lib/domain/expenses/ pure, tested money rules: balances, totals, breakdowns, budgets,
                       validation (no React, no storage)
  features/preview/    SAMPLE DATA for the design preview — delete when real data lands

  lib/formatting/      display-only money/percent formatting (integer paise in)
  state/               small Zustand UI store (no financial data)
  theme/               tokens, typography, semantic colours (light/dark), motion, ThemeProvider
```

## Conventions

- **Colours** come from semantic roles in `src/theme/colors.ts`; no hex values elsewhere.
  `src/theme/__tests__/contrast.test.ts` enforces WCAG contrast for every text/UI pairing.
- **Icons** are imported from `@/components/icons` (per-icon imports). Importing the
  `lucide-react-native` barrel is a lint error because it adds ~2 MB to the web bundle.
- **Money** is passed to UI as integer minor units (paise); formatting happens only at display.
- **Motion** uses React Native's built-in `Animated` (no Reanimated: it cost ~140 KiB gzip on
  web). Timings come from `useMotion()`, which honours the OS reduced-motion setting; `Appear`
  and `useSlidingIndicator` cover entrances and moving selection indicators.
- **Focus rings** show for keyboard focus only (`useInteractionState` follows :focus-visible).
- **Responsive layouts** are chosen per breakpoint (`useBreakpoint`), not shrunk from desktop.
- **Single-screen pages** (all Expenses pages, Accounts, Mutual funds, Stocks) use `<Screen fit>`: on desktop the
  page never scrolls and panels scroll internally; windows 700–819 px tall get a denser layout,
  and below 700 px the page scrolls rather than clipping. Tablets and phones always scroll.
- Web output is a single-page app; `vercel.json` rewrites unknown paths to `index.html`. To
  deploy, create a Vercel project from this repo with **Root Directory** `apps/command-center`;
  `vercel.json` supplies the install, build (`npm run build:web`) and output (`dist`) settings.
